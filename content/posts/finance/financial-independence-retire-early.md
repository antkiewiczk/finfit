# FIRE Movement: Achieving Financial Independence and Retiring Early

The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is revolutionizing how people think about work, money, and life. By combining extreme savings with strategic investing, FIRE adherents aim to achieve financial freedom decades before traditional retirement age.

## What is FIRE?

### Core Principles
1. **Financial Independence (FI)**: Having enough investment income to cover living expenses
2. **Retire Early (RE)**: Choosing to leave traditional employment, not necessarily stopping work
3. **The 4% Rule**: Safe withdrawal rate from investments
4. **Savings Rate**: Percentage of income saved, not spent

### The Math Behind FIRE
**Formula**: 25x annual expenses = Financial Independence
**Example**: $40,000 annual expenses × 25 = $1,000,000 needed

**The 4% Rule**:
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio annually
- Adjusted for inflation each year
- Historically survives 30+ years (95% success rate)
- **$1,000,000 portfolio** = $40,000/year income

## Types of FIRE

### 1. LeanFIRE
**Annual expenses**: $25,000-40,000
**Portfolio needed**: $625,000-1,000,000
**Lifestyle**: Minimalist, frugal living
**Best for**: Singles, low-cost areas, extreme minimalists

### 2. Regular FIRE
**Annual expenses**: $40,000-70,000
**Portfolio needed**: $1,000,000-1,750,000
**Lifestyle**: Comfortable but not extravagant
**Best for**: Most families, moderate cost areas

### 3. FatFIRE
**Annual expenses**: $70,000-200,000+
**Portfolio needed**: $1,750,000-5,000,000+
**Lifestyle**: Luxurious, travel, hobbies
**Best for**: High earners, dual-income couples

### 4. BaristaFIRE
**Partial retirement**: Work part-time for benefits/extra income
**Portfolio**: Covers most expenses, work covers rest
**Benefits**: Health insurance, social interaction, reduced stress
**Best for**: Those who enjoy work but want more freedom

### 5. CoastFIRE
**Save enough early**: Investments grow to retirement amount without further contributions
**Continue working**: But only for current expenses
**Example**: Save $200,000 by age 30, let it grow to $1,000,000 by 60
**Best for**: Young savers who want flexibility later

## The FIRE Timeline

### Years 0-5: Foundation Building
**Focus**: Increase income, reduce expenses, establish savings rate
**Goals**:
- Save 50%+ of income
- Pay off high-interest debt
- Build emergency fund
- Start investing in tax-advantaged accounts

### Years 5-10: Acceleration
**Focus**: Maximize savings, optimize investments, increase income
**Goals**:
- Save 60-70% of income
- Max out all retirement accounts
- Consider real estate investing
- Develop side income streams

### Years 10-15: The Home Stretch

**Goals**:

## Calculating Your FIRE Number

### Step 1: Determine Annual Expenses
**Track everything** for 3-6 months:
- Housing (mortgage/rent, taxes, insurance, maintenance)
- Utilities (electric, water, gas, internet, phone)
- Food (groceries, dining out)
- Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance)
- Healthcare (insurance, out-of-pocket, medications)
- Insurance (life, disability, umbrella)
- Entertainment (travel, hobbies, subscriptions)
- Miscellaneous (clothing, gifts, personal care)

### Step 2: Apply the 25x Rule
**Formula**: Annual expenses × 25 = FIRE number
**Example**: $50,000 expenses × 25 = $1,250,000 needed

### Step 3: Adjust for Your Situation
**Consider**:
- **Healthcare costs**: Higher before Medicare eligibility
- **Children**: Education costs, may decrease when they leave
- **Mortgage**: Include if not paid off, exclude if will be
- **Travel**: More in early retirement, less later
- **Inflation**: Use today's dollars, investments should outpace

### Step 4: Calculate Time to FIRE
**Formula**: 
```
Years to FI = log(1 + (WR × NW / SR)) / log(1 + r)
Where:
WR = Withdrawal rate (0.04 for 4%)
NW = Net worth needed
SR = Annual savings
r = Expected real return (after inflation)
```
