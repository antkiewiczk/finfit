# Real Estate Investing Basics: Building Wealth Through Property

Real estate investing has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle. Whether you're looking for passive income, long-term appreciation, or portfolio diversification, real estate offers unique opportunities for wealth building.

## Why Invest in Real Estate?

### Historical Performance

- **Tax advantages**: Deductions, depreciation, 1031 exchanges
- **Cash flow**: Monthly rental income

### Wealth Building Benefits

3. **Equity build-up**: Mortgage paydown by tenants
4. **Tax benefits**: Deductions and deferrals

## Analyzing Investment Properties

### The 1% Rule
**Monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price**
**Example**: $200,000 property should rent for $2,000/month
**Use**: Quick screening tool

### The 50% Rule
**Operating expenses will be about 50% of gross rent**
**Example**: $2,000/month rent = $1,000/month expenses
**Expenses include**: Taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancies, management

### Cash Flow Calculation
```
Monthly Rent: $2,000
- Mortgage: $800
- Taxes: $200
- Insurance: $100
- Maintenance: $200
- Vacancy (5%): $100
- Management (8%): $160
= Cash Flow: $440/month
```

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
**Formula**: Net Operating Income ÷ Purchase Price
**Example**: $24,000 NOI ÷ $300,000 price = 8% cap rate
**Use**: Compare different property types/locations

### Cash-on-Cash Return
**Formula**: Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested
**Example**: $5,280 annual cash flow ÷ $60,000 invested = 8.8%
**Use**: Measure return on your actual cash investment
