# Retirement Planning: How to Secure Your Financial Future

Retirement planning is one of the most important financial journeys you'll undertake. Whether you're just starting your career or approaching retirement age, it's never too early or too late to plan for your golden years.

## Why Retirement Planning Matters

### The Retirement Reality Check
- **Average retirement age**: 62-65
- **Average life expectancy**: 78-85 years
- **Years in retirement**: 15-25+ years
- **Healthcare costs**: $300,000+ for a couple
- **Social Security replacement**: 40% of pre-retirement income

### The Power of Starting Early
**Example**: Saving $500/month starting at age 25 vs. 35
- **Starting at 25** (40 years): $1.4 million at 65 (7% return)
- **Starting at 35** (30 years): $567,000 at 65 (7% return)
- **Difference**: $833,000 more by starting 10 years earlier

## Retirement Savings Goals

### The 4% Rule
A common guideline suggests you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement savings annually.

**Calculation**: Desired annual income ÷ 0.04 = Target retirement savings

**Example**: Want $60,000/year in retirement?
- $60,000 ÷ 0.04 = $1,500,000 needed

### Age-Based Savings Benchmarks
**By age 30**: 1x your annual salary saved
**By age 40**: 3x your annual salary saved
**By age 50**: 6x your annual salary saved
**By age 60**: 8x your annual salary saved
**By age 67**: 10x your annual salary saved

## Retirement Accounts

### 1. 401(k) Plans
**Employer-sponsored retirement plan**
- **Contribution limit 2026**: $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)
- **Employer match**: Free money (typically 3-6% match)
- **Tax treatment**: Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax)
- **Withdrawals**: Penalty-free at 59½, required at 72

**Maximizing your 401(k)**:
1. Contribute enough to get full employer match
2. Increase contributions annually
3. Consider Roth option if in lower tax bracket
4. Review investment options regularly

### 2. IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
**Personal retirement account**
- **Contribution limit 2026**: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- **Types**: Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA
- **Income limits**: Apply to Roth IRA contributions
- **Tax advantages**: Tax-deferred or tax-free growth

**Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
- **Traditional**: Tax deduction now, taxed on withdrawal
- **Roth**: After-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals
- **Choose Roth if**: Expect higher tax bracket in retirement

### 3. HSA (Health Savings Account)
**Triple tax advantage for healthcare**
- **Contributions**: Tax-deductible
- **Growth**: Tax-free
- **Withdrawals**: Tax-free for qualified medical expenses
- **After 65**: Can withdraw for any purpose (taxed as income)

**Strategy**: Max out HSA, pay medical expenses from cash flow, let HSA grow for retirement healthcare costs.

### 4. Taxable Brokerage Accounts
**No contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions**
- **Flexibility**: Access money anytime
- **Tax treatment**: Capital gains taxes apply
- **Use**: Supplement retirement savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

## Investment Strategies for Retirement

### Asset Allocation by Age
**Rule of thumb**: 110 - your age = % in stocks

**Examples**:
- **Age 30**: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- **Age 50**: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- **Age 65**: 45% stocks, 55% bonds

### Target Date Funds
**Automatically adjust allocation as you approach retirement**
- **Example**: Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund
- **Pros**: Hands-off, professionally managed
- **Cons**: Higher fees than DIY portfolio

### The Three-Fund Portfolio
**Simple, diversified approach**:
1. **Total US Stock Market Index Fund**: 50%
2. **Total International Stock Index Fund**: 30%
3. **Total Bond Market Index Fund**: 20%

## Social Security Planning

### When to Claim Benefits
**Full Retirement Age (FRA)**: 67 for those born 1960+
**Early claiming**: As early as 62 (reduced benefits)
**Delayed claiming**: Up to 70 (increased benefits)

**Monthly benefit comparison** (assuming $2,000 at FRA):
- **Age 62**: $1,400 (30% reduction)
- **Age 67**: $2,000 (full benefit)
- **Age 70**: $2,480 (24% increase)

### Maximizing Social Security
**Strategies**:
1. **Delay claiming**: 8% annual increase from FRA to 70
2. **Coordinate with spouse**: Consider spousal benefits
3. **Work 35+ years**: Benefits based on highest 35 earning years
4. **Check earnings record**: Ensure accuracy

## Healthcare in Retirement

### Medicare Basics
**Part A**: Hospital insurance (free for most)
**Part B**: Medical insurance ($174.70/month in 2026)
**Part C**: Medicare Advantage (private plans)
**Part D**: Prescription drug coverage

### Estimated Healthcare Costs
**Average couple at 65**: $315,000 in retirement
**Annual costs at 65**: $7,000-10,000
**Long-term care**: $50,000-100,000/year

### Planning for Healthcare
1. **Maximize HSA contributions**
2. **Consider long-term care insurance**
3. **Budget for Medicare premiums**
4. **Plan for out-of-pocket costs**
